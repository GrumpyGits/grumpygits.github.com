![Patchwork, Githubbers and Mentors](/images/2016-06-25-github-patchwork-singapore.jpg)

Join us as we host this Patchwork with our good friends at [GitHub](https://github.com/) for a morning of hands-on hacking and learning about Git and GitHub.

A host of GitHubbers, as well as local community mentors, will be on hand to walk you through your choice of learning modules:

* Introduction to Git
* Introduction to GitHub
* Creating a Site with GitHub Pages

If you have questions about the command line, GUIs, or anything Git and GitHub-related, we're here to help.

Food and refreshments will be available.

__If you do not yet have a GitHub account, we ask that you sign up at https://github.com before you attend the event. It's fast, easy, and of course, free. That way you'll be ready to go right out of the gate.__

_Mentors, you'll receive an email a few days before the event with details about what to expect and the curriculum._
