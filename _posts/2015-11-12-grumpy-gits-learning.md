## Learning is better together

We will be on hand to walk you through the [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) tutorial, answer your questions, help you create your first open source project and achieve your first merged pull request.

We'll begin with a story about getting started in open source, spend time on the tutorial in small groups, and then close things out with a lightning talk.
