[Patchwork](https://patchwork.github.io/) is a self-directed hands-on workshop for learning Git and GitHub. You will be able to go at your own pace, with the help of a community mentor nearby in case you run into any trouble. Join us for an afternoon of hacking and snacking and make some new friends while you're at it!

No programming experience needed! 

*Forks you don't eat with? Branches not made of wood?*

**Newcomers to Git and GitHub** 

You'll leave with a merged [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/), a square on your [contributions graph](https://help.github.com/articles/viewing-contributions), and confidence to get more involved in the open source community.

**Mentors** 

If you've ever had a pull request merged, now is your chance to share the love and help someone else create magic.

## Learning is better together

GitHubbers [@jesseplusplus](https://github.com/jesseplusplus), [@donal](https://github.com/donal), and local community mentors, will be on hand to walk you through the [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) tutorial, answer your questions, help you create your first open source project and achieve your first merged pull request.

We'll begin with a story about getting started in open source, spend time on the tutorial in small groups, and then close things out with a lightning talk from open source community member.
