title: Github PatchWork Singapore - 6th June 2015
tldr: Learning is better together! No coding experience needed
---



### No coding experience needed
--- 

Patchwork is a self-directed hands-on workshop for learning Git and GitHub. You will be able to go at your own pace, with the help of a community mentor nearby in case you run into any trouble. Join us for an afternoon of hacking and snacking and make some new friends while you're at it!

*Forks you don't eat with? Branches not made of wood?*

Newcomers to Git and GitHub: you'll leave with a merged [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/), a square on your [contributions graph](https://help.github.com/articles/viewing-contributions), and confidence to get more involved in the open source community.

Mentors: if you've ever had a pull request merged, now is your chance to share the love and help someone else create magic.

### Learning is better together

[@jesseplusplus](https://github.com/jesseplusplus), [@donal](https://github.com/donal), and local community mentors, will be on hand to walk you through the [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) tutorial, answer your questions, help you create your first open source project and achieve your first merged pull request.

We'll begin with a story about getting started in open source, spend time on the tutorial in small groups, and then close things out with a lightning talk from open source community member.
