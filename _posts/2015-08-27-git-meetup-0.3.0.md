title: Git Meetup 0.3.0
---

It's high time we had our third meetup!

This meetup is aimed at both beginners and people who have over 10 years of Git experience (wait a minute…). We hope to stretch your Gitability level, and better your understanding of version control systems!

## Programme:

- "Lessons learned from taking a product from closed to open source": [Jason Pang](https://github.com/iamjasonp)
- "Working with Git Trees": [Eric Ng](https://github.com/zwodahs)
- "Your Git history sucks": [Rahul AG](https://github.com/rahulg)
- "AWS CodeCommit, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline": [Parijat Mishra](https://sg.linkedin.com/in/parijatmishra)
- Lightning talks — we're looking for more!
