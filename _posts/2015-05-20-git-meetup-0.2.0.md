title: Git Meetup 0.2.0
---

It's time for the second meetup!

This meetup is aimed at both beginners and people who have over 10 years of Git experience (wait a minute\...). We hope to stretch your Gitability level, and better your understanding of version control systems!

## Programme

- **Debugging with Git** - [Ryan Dao](https://github.com/ryandao)
  
  Git is more than just a version control system. It's also one of the best debugging tools if used correctly. In this talk I'm going to show how Git and Delta Debugging can be used to help identify issues in your codebase.

- **Interactive rebasing with Git** - [Jason Chionh](https://github.com/jchionh)

  In this short talk, we'll go through the command "git rebase -i". This is git rebasing in interactive mode. You can use it to organize local commit history. Specifically, we'll look at squashing many commits into one commit and re-ordering commits.

- **Lightning talk: Stashing, yo!** - [Angelo Rohit](https://github.com/angelorohit)
- **Lightning talk: Pull request, yo!** - Lian Hau Lee

Come merge with your fellow Gits!
