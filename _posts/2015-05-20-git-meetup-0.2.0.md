It's time for the second meetup!

This meetup is aimed at both beginners and people who have over 10 years of Git experience (wait a minute...). We hope to stretch your Gitability level, and better your understanding of version control systems!

## Programme

  Git is more than just a version control system. It's also one of the best debugging tools if used correctly. In this talk I'm going to show how Git and Delta Debugging can be used to help identify issues in your codebase.

  In this short talk, we'll go through the command "git rebase -i". This is git rebasing in interactive mode. You can use it to organize local commit history. Specifically, we'll look at squashing many commits into one commit and re-ordering commits.
