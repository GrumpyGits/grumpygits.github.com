NOTE: This event is part of FOSSASIA 2016.

_Git and GitHub Workshop_

Mike McQuaid, maintainer of the Homebrew package manager and Platform engineer
at GitHub will be at hand to help you create your first open source project.

This is a self-directed and hands-on workshop for people who want to learn Git,
GitHub, or GitHub Pages. You’ll leave with a merged Pull Request, a square on
your contributions graph, and confidence to get more involved in the open
source community.

If you’re an experienced GitHub user, we’d love for you to join the session as
a mentor.
